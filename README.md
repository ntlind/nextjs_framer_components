# Next.js Framer Example

A clone of the code behind [Quantile's website](https://quantile.app), with /public redacted.


## Custom Components

This template contains a few custom components that I enjoy using:

### Animated, responsive hamburger menu

### Markdown-to-HTML generation with sidebar table-of-contents

### Canvas backgrounds that draw themselves over time

### [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) text transitions (e.g., slide-in)

## Getting Started

First, install this repository using:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ntlind/nextjs-minimalist-websume
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the locally-built page.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
